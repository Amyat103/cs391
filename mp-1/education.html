          I studied my K-12 at Yangon International School, a school located in
          Yangon, Myanmar<br /><br />
          After that I decided that I want to study in the US, so I applied to
          University of La Verne as a Business Administration Major<br /><br />
          After 3 years, I decided that I want to change school, so I changed my
          major as well to Computer Science and I transferred into BU and switch
          my major to cs at the fall of 2023.<br /><br />
